# luasocket: Network support for the Lua language

```lua
local socket = require "socket"
```

The socket package is based on [Lua
Socket](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/) and adapted for `luax`.

The documentation of `Lua Socket` is available at the [Lua Socket documentation
web site](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/reference.html).
