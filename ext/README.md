Third-party modules
===================

[`ext/c`](c) contains third-party modules written in C
that can not be bundled with the pure Lua implementation of `luax.lua`.
Some of them may have been reimplemented in Lua in [`libluax`](../libluax).

[`ext/lua`](lua) contains third-party modules entirely written in Lua
that can be bundled with the pure Lua implementation of `luax.lua`.
